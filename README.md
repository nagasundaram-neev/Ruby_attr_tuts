==============

Accessors helps to set and get the valus of instance variables of class

In ruby 
1. We can write user defined method for getter and setter (accessors) #see the first commit of car.rb
2. We can use shorthand way to write accessor # see the second commit of car.rb
3. We can use the attr_writer, attr_reader # see the third commit of car.rb
4. We can use the attr_accessor instead of using attr_reader and attr_writer # see the final commit
